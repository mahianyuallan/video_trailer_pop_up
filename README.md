bash
Copy
Edit
cd video_trailer_pop_up

📝 How It Works
The "Watch Now" button removes the active class from the .trailer-container, making it visible.

Clicking the close icon adds back the active class, hiding the video.

CSS transitions create a smooth fade effect.

📌 Future Improvements
Pause video automatically when closing the pop-up.

Add multiple trailers with dynamic selection.

Implement autoplay when the trailer opens.
